# EVENSTAR - GetCPL

## Version
- `v1.0.0`

## Brief
- `ISA: x86`
- `Mode: Real, Protected, Long`
- `Bitness: 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit`
- `CPL: 0, 3`
- `OS: Windows`
- `Language: C`
- Sample code that demonstrates the usage of the `SMSW` instruction to fetch the the `Machine Status Word` (bits 0 through 15 of control register `CR0`) and check the processor's `Current Privilege Level (CPL)` if the processor is running in `Protected` mode.

## Usage
- There aren't a lot of useful bits in the `MSW`
- One notable exception: `PE (Protection Enable)` bit (0)
- This flag enables Segmentation
- The processor maintains an internal state called `CPL` which is defined as the privilege level of the currently executing code
- `CPL` is used to determine whether certain operations are permitted or not
- `CPL` is given by `CS.RPL` (bits 0 and 1)
